# Questionit Backend

This is the BackEnd of an exam application for ProgramIT (http://www.programit.nl/). The intention was that the trainers created questions in the app to better prepare students for their exam. The project was abandoned before it was completed.

The application was divided in a BackEnd and FrontEnd. The latter can be found in another repository: https://github.com/FaerieRose/questionit.ui

## FaerieRose Comment

I was mainly involved during the start of this project. I created the initial Class Diagram and pom.xml file and made the base in Eclipse. Colleagues of mine continued on the project while I started preparing my classes.
